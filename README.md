# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

### Introduction
In this project allows to use the included Packer and Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository

2. Create your infrastructure as code

3. Update this README to reflect how someone would use your code.

### Dependencies
1. Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com) 
2. Install the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
4. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Instructions
####1. Deploy the Packer image using the provided Packer template

In order to configure the environment variables use this snippet:
```
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ARM_CLIENT_ID
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=YOUR_ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
export ARM_TENANT_ID=YOUR_ARM_TENANT_ID
```
In order to retrieve the needed values be sure to follow [this tutorial](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/service_principal_client_secret).

Create a resource group in Azure:
```
az group create -n tagging-policy-rg -l eastus
```

Create a policy in Azure:
```
az policy definition create --name allResourcesMustHaveTags --rules azure_policy_all_indexed_resources_in_subscription_must_have_tags.json
```

Show the created policy:
```
az policy assignment list
```
![az policy assignment list screenshot](images/az_policy_assignment_list.png)


Deploy the Packer image:  
```packer build server.json```

####2. Deploy the infrastructure using the provided Terraform template

Initialize Terraform:  
```terraform init```

Prepare the plan:  
```terraform plan -out solution.plan```

Deploy the plan:  
```terraform apply solution.plan```

### Output
```

E:\bitbucket\azure-cloud-devops-scalable-iaas-webserver (main -> origin)
Î» terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with
the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
